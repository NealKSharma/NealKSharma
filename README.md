# Hey, I'm Neal Kaushik Sharma  

🎓 Computer Science @ Iowa State University  
💡 Honors Student • AI & Software Engineering  

I like building things that actually work — web apps, backend systems, and machine learning projects. I’m especially interested in how software and AI come together to solve real problems. I enjoy working in teams, learning from people around me, and figuring things out by building.
